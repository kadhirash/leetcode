# leetcode
A culmination of my progress on Leetcode problems to help prepare me for technical interviews. I currently have Leetcode Premium, and premium problems will be marked with "🤐"

My plan is to start with some easy problems, get comfortable then move onto medium and hard problems. 

As of June 2020, I plan to use Python as I find it less verbose and easier to arrive to solutions.

I still will have some old C++ and Java solutions from time to time as I know C++ the most throughout my college career and Java was the first programming language I picked up. Feel free to contribute! 

Here is my current [profile](https://leetcode.com/kaddy/)

I have split the problems by difficulty in separate folders, and plan to organize them further as the number of completed problems increase! 

As the saying goes, 

> "A Leetcode a day keeps unemployment away."

Best of luck on your journey!
