# leetcode
A culmination of my progress on Leetcode problems. I currently have Leetcode Premium, and premium problems will be marked with a "P."
"E = Easy, M = Medium, H = Hard"

My plan is to start with some easy problems, get comfortable then move onto medium and hard problems. 

As of June 2020, I plan to use Python as I find it less verbose and easier to arrive to solutions.
