# leetcode
A culmination of my progress on Leetcode problems. I currently have Leetcode Premium, and premium problems will be marked with a "P."
"E = Easy, M = Medium, H = Hard"

My plan is to start with some easy problems, get comfortable then move onto medium and hard problems. 

As of June 2020, I plan to use Python as I find it less verbose and easier to arrive to solutions.

Here is my current [profile](https://leetcode.com/kaddy/)

I have split the problems by difficulty in separate folders, and tried to categorize them by concept as well.
